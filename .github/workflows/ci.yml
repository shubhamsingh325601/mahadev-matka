name: Node.js CI (Pull Request Check)

# Trigger this workflow when a Pull Request is opened, reopened, or updated
on:
  pull_request:
    # Ensure the target branch (base branch) is correct.
    # Adjust 'master' if your main branch is called 'main'
    branches: [ "master", "develop" ]

jobs:
  test-and-validate:
    # Use a specific, common Node.js CI environment
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Check out code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4 # Use the latest version

      # Matrix strategy to test on multiple Node.js versions is often a good practice
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4 # Use the latest version
        with:
          node-version: '18.x' # Use '18.x' for better maintenance
          cache: 'npm' # Caches node modules

      - name: Install Dependencies
        # 'npm ci' requires a package-lock.json and is faster for CI
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run Lint Check
        # This will FAIL the job if lint errors are found, enforcing pre-merge fixes.
        run: npm run lint

      # 🚨 RECOMMENDED: Uncomment this to ensure your code is functionally correct!
